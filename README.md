# **What are the strange comments about?**

We're collaborating over vscode, and decided to use comments as a sort of 'chat'. Then we decided to not delete any comments. This is how it turned out. Please don't mind the comments about the_froggie being a slave. Really. Don't mind. Thanks. Don't do anything -3665
