# **Castaway**
## Made by ClicksMinutePer
## version 0.0.1 Alpha

# **What is this?**

The game Castaway is a discord idle game where you have been cast away on an island with other server members. The goal of this game is to flee the island by building some sort of transport to sail away from this desolate land. You will need to cooperate ~~*or not...*~~ with your comrades to join forces and survive days after days until your community build a vessel or stay stranded here until you succumb to ~~*being too bored to continue and rage quitting*~~ a horrible death...

# **How to play?**
You can either invite our copy of the bot, [join our server and play with us](https://discord.gg/bPaNnxe) or host your own. Here are the steps for self hosting:

# **What are the strange comments about?**

We're collaborating over vscode, and decided to use comments as a sort of 'chat'. Then we decided to not delete any comments. This is how it turned out. Please don't mind the comments about the_froggie being a slave. Really. Don't mind. Thanks. Don't do anything -3665
